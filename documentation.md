## Description of the assignment
The music visuals assignment, a program that works on visual graphics based on a pre-loaded audio. In our project, there is three scenes created by each member of the group in which each of us created visuals that react to the choosen song, "Different Heaven & EH!DE - My Heart [NCS Release]". 

These visuals were generated based on knowledge gained in classes or by internet research. Among the three scenes there are elements that are responive to the sound either by changing colours, shapes, or size. 

## Instructions
(need to check this) The files for this assignemnt are located in java/src/ie/tudublin of the Music Visuals-2 folder. You can run our assignment from the Main.java file. 

## How it works
(need to check this) Once the file is ran from the main, a fullscreen processing window is display where the song and a loading bar is displayed. When the loading bar is completed, the first scene is shown. After around 1min 30secs, press *num1* for the second scene. After around 2mins, press *num2* for the third scene. To leave the visualisation, press *Esc*. 


* Scene 1 - Shows an audio responsive element which has a circle in the middle with elements that move outward and inward with the music (similar to a galaxy). There are three different colours - purple, orchid, and white. The colours are fixed elements. The image below shows a rough cut of scene 1:

* Scene 2 - Shows a landscape/terrain feature that moves and changes colour responding to the audio. there is also a sphere above the terrain that is responsive to the music.

* Scene 3 - Shows a planet system. A planet is fixed into position while two flat elements rotate around it. The colours are fixed, however if the mouse pad is clicked the inside of the planet changes colour.
