## Description of the assignment
The music visuals assignment, a program that works on visual graphics based on a pre-loaded audio. In our project, there is three scenes created by each member of the group in which each of us created visuals that react to the choosen song, "Different Heaven & EH!DE - My Heart [NCS Release]". 

These visuals were generated based on knowledge gained in classes or by internet research. Among the three scenes there are elements that are responive to the sound either by changing colours, shapes, or size. 

## Instructions
(need to check this) The files for this assignemnt are located in java/src/ie/tudublin of the Music Visuals-2 folder. You can run our assignment from the Main.java file. 

## How it works
(need to check this) Once the file is ran from the main, a fullscreen processing window is display where the song and a loading bar is displayed. When the loading bar is completed, the first scene is shown.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
